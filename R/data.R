#' @title STAR participants plus nonexperimental controls
#'
#' @description Data from Tennesseeâ€™s Project STAR study.
#'   This data frame describes student participants in the Project
#'   STAR (Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio) field experiment
#'   conducted in Tennessee, USA beginning in the mid-1980s, as well
#'   as an external control group consisting of the contemporaneous
#'   cohort of students attending a matched sample of Tennessee
#'   schools that did not participate in the STAR experiment.
#'   Variables are as described in Project \code{STAR} data
#'   documentation (see references), with the exception of the
#'   three \code{*_at_entry} variables. These variables were reconstructed
#'   as follows: \code{grade_at_entry} indicates the grade of student's
#'   first participation, while \code{school_at_entry} and
#'   \code{cond_at_entry} reflect the school ID and classroom type corresponding
#'   to the student's grade at entry to the study.

#' @title Cluster-randomized experiment data on voter turnout in cable system markets
#'
#' @description This dataset is a toy example derived from a cluster-randomized
#' field experiment that evaluates the effect of \dQuote{Rock the Vote} TV advertisements
#' on voter turnout rate. The original study included 23,869 first-time voters
#' across 85 cable television markets in 12 states. These markets were grouped
#' into matched sets based on their past voter turnout rates and then randomly
#' assigned to either a treatment or control condition. This toy dataset is
#' constructed by randomly sampling 10% of individuals from selected cable
#' television markets in the original dataset.
#'
#' @format A \code{data.frame} with 248 rows and 7 columns.
#' \itemize{
#'   \item {age} Age of participant
#'   \item {vote_04} Outcome variable indicating whether participant voted
#'   \item {tv_company} Cable system serving participant's residential area
#'   \item {treatment} Binary variable denoting treatment assignment
#'   \item {pairs} A numeric indicator for the strata or matched pair group to which a cable system belongs (1-3)
#'   \item {population_size} Total population size of residential area served by cable system
#'   \item {sample_size} Number of individuals sampled from the cable system cluster
#' }
#'
#' @details The original dataset was drawn from a randomized controlled trial in
#' which 85 cable system areas were first grouped into 40 matched sets based on
#' historical voter turnout. Within each matched set, one cable system area was
#' randomly assigned to the treatment condition, while the others served
#' as controls.
#'
#' This toy dataset includes a subset of the original replication data,
#' specifically individuals from matched sets 1â€“3, which encompass 7 of the 85
#' cable system areas. Within these selected clusters, a 10% random sample of
#' individuals was taken.
