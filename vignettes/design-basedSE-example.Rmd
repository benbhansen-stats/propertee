## Example Data

The data came from a clustered randomized controlled trial conducted to evaluate the effects of an intervention designed to encourage water consumption among children in after school programs at Boston. A total of 20 sites were recruited and matched into 10 pairs. Within each pair, one site was randomly selected to receive the treatment, OSNAP (``Out of School Nutrition and Physical Activity"), and the other received the control.
