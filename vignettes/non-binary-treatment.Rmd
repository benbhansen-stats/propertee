## Binary Treatment

When creating a Design, handling binary treatment variables is straightforward.
If the treatment variable is either `numeric` with only values 0/1, or is
`logical`, then `lmitt()` will estimate a treatment effect of the difference
between the outcome in the treated group (`1` or `TRUE`) versus the control
group (`0` or `FALSE`).

### Missing treatment status

In all cases (binary and non-binary), missing values are allowed and any units
of assignment with missing treatment values are excluded from models fit via
`lmitt()`.

## Non-binary Treatment

However, the [`_design()`](../reference/Design_objects.html) functions can take
in any (reasonable) form of treatment assignment.

If the treatment variable is a `numeric` with non-binary values, it is treated
as a continuous treatment effect and `lmitt(y ~ 1, ...` will estimate a single
coefficient on treatment.

If the treatment variable is a `character`, it is treated as a multi-level
treatment variable and `lmitt(y ~ 1, ...` will estimate treatment effects
against a reference category. The reference category is the first level defined
according to [R's comparison of characters](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html).

`factor` and `ordered` objects are tricky to deal with, so while a `Design` can
be created with `factor` or `ordered` treatment variables, `lmitt()` will refuse
to estimate a model unless it is also provided a
[`dichotomy`](#dichotomzing-a-non-binary-treatment) (see below).

### Dichotomzing a Non-binary Treatment

Studies may offer treatment to units at different times or provide treatment to
units in varying intensities. Researchers may be interested in estimating treatment
effects at different times or given a certain threshold of provided treatment, however.
`propertee` accommodates these wishes by storing the time or intensity of treatment
for treated units in the  [`Design`](../reference/Design_objects.html), then offering
a `dichotomy=` argument to the weights calculation functions `ett()`/`ate()` and the
assginment creation function `assigned()` A `dichotomy` is presented as a
formula, where the left-hand side is a logical statement defining inclusion in
the treatment group, and the right-hand side is a logical statement defining
inclusion in the control group. For example, if `dose` represents the intensity
of a given treatment, we could set a threshold of 200, say, mg:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dose > 200 ~ dose <= 200
```

All units of assignment with `dose` above 200 are treated units,
and all units of assignment with `dose` of 200 or below are control units.

A `.` can be used to define either group as the inverse of the other. For
example, the above dichotomy could be defined as either of

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dose > 200 ~ .
. ~ dose <= 200
```

Any units of assignment not assigned to either treatment or control are assumed
to have `NA` for a treatment status and will be ignored in the estimation of
treatment effects.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dose >= 300 ~ dose <= 100
```

In this `dichotomy`, units of assignment in the range (100,300) are ignored.

### An Example

```{r}
data(simdata)
table(simdata$dose)
des1 <- rct_design(dose ~ uoa(uoa1, uoa2), data = simdata)
summary(des1)
```

```{r}
head(ate(des1, data = simdata, dichotomy = dose >= 300 ~ dose <= 100))
```

```{r}
head(assigned(des1, data = simdata, dichotomy = dose >= 300 ~ dose <= 100))
```
