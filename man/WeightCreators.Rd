\arguments{
\item{specification}{optional; a \code{StudySpecification} object created by
one of \code{rct_spec()}, \code{rd_spec()}, or \code{obs_spec()}.}

\item{dichotomy}{optional; a formula defining the dichotomy of the treatment
variable if it isn't already \code{0}/\code{1}. See details for more
information. If \code{ett()} or \code{ate()} is called within a
\code{lmitt()} call that specifies a \code{dichotomy} argument, that
\code{dichotomy} will be used if the argument here has not been specified.}

\item{by}{optional; named vector or list connecting names of unit of
assignment/ variables in \code{specification} to unit of
assignment/unitid/cluster variables in \code{data}. Names represent
variables in the StudySpecification; values represent variables in the
data. Only needed if variable names differ.}

\item{data}{optional; the data for the analysis to be performed on. May be
excluded if these functions are included as the \code{weights} argument of
a model.}
}
\value{
a \code{WeightedStudySpecification} object, which is a vector of
numeric weights
}
\description{
These should primarily be used inside models. See Details.
}
\details{
These functions should primarily be used in the \code{weight}
argument of \code{\link[=lmitt]{lmitt()}} or\code{\link[=lm]{lm()}}. All arguments are optional if used within
those functions. If used on their own, \code{specification} and
\code{data} must be provided.
\itemize{
\item \code{ate} - Average treatment effect. Aliases: \code{ate()}.
\item \code{ett} - Effect of treatment on the treated. Aliases: \code{ett()},
\code{att()}.
\item \code{etc} - Effect of treatment on controls. Aliases: \code{etc()},
\code{atc()}.
\item \code{ato} - Overlap-weighted average effect. Aliases: \code{ato()},
\code{olw}, \code{owt}, \code{pwt}.
}

In a \code{StudySpecification} with \code{block}s, the weights are
generated as a function of the ratio of the number of treated units in a
block versus the total number of units in a block.

In any blocks where that ratio is 0 or 1 (that is, all units in the block
have the same treatment status), the weights will be 0. In effect this
removes from the target population any block in which there is no basis
for estimating either means under treatment or means under control.

If block is missing for a given observation, a weight of 0 is applied.

A \code{dichotomy} is specified by a \code{formula} consisting of a
conditional statement on both the left-hand side (identifying treatment
levels associated with "treatment") and the right hand side (identifying
treatment levels associated with "control"). For example, if your
treatment variable was called \code{dose} and doses above 250 are
considered treatment, you might write:

\code{ate(..., dichotomy = dose > 250 ~ dose <= 250}

The period (\code{.}) can be used to assign all other units of assignment.
For example, we could have written the same treatment regime as either

\code{etc(..., dichotomy = dose > 250 ~ .}

or

\code{olw(..., dichotomy = . ~ dose <= 250}

The \code{dichotomy} formula supports Relational Operators (see
\link{Comparison}), Logical Operators (see \link{Logic}), and \code{\%in\%} (see
\code{\link[=match]{match()}}).

The conditionals need not assign all values of treatment to control or
treatment, for example, \code{dose > 300 ~ dose < 200} does not assign
\code{200 <= dose <= 300} to either treatment or control. This would be
equivalent to manually generating a binary variable with \code{NA}
whenever \code{dose} is between 200 and 300. Standard errors will reflect
the sizes of the comparison groups specified by the \code{dichotomy}.

Tim Lycurgus contributed code for the computation of weights. The
\sQuote{overlap weight} concept is due to Li, Morgan and Zaslavsky
(2018), although the current implementation differs from that
discussed in their paper in that it avoids estimated propensity scores.
