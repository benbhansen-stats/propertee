\usage{
.prepare_design_matrix(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a fitted \code{teeMod} model}
}
\value{
a \eqn{m \items (p+2)} matrix of cluster sums of design-based
estimating equations scaled by \eqn{\sqrt{m_{b0}m_{b1}}/m_{b}}.
Here \eqn{m} is the number of clusters, \eqn{p} is the number of covariates
used in the prior covariance adjustment (excluding intercept)
