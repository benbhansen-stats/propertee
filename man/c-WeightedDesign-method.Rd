\usage{
\S4method{c}{WeightedDesign}(x, ..., force_dichotomy_equal = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, }{.. a \code{WeightedDesign} object, typically created from \code{\link[=ate]{ate()}}
or \code{\link[=ett]{ett()}}}

\item{...}{any number of additional \code{WeightedDesign} objects with
equivalent \code{Design} to \code{x} and eachother}

\item{force_dichotomy_equal}{if \code{FALSE} (default), \code{Design}s are
considered equivalent even if their \code{dichotomy} differs. If
\code{TRUE}, \code{@dichotomy} must also be equal.}
}
\value{
If all \code{WeightedDesign} objects contain the same
\code{dichotomy} (including \code{NULL}), a new \code{WeightedDesign} with
the weights concatenated in the input order.

If \code{force_dichotomy_equal} is \code{FALSE} and the
\code{WeightedDesign} objects differ in their dichotomies, a
\code{CombinedWeightedDesign} is returned. This functions essentially
identically to a \code{WeightedDesign}, but carries with it the
dichotimization information that came from each of the individual
\code{WeightedDesign}.
}
\description{
Given several variations of weights generated from a single
\code{Design}, combine into a single weight.
}
\details{
Concatenating \code{WeightedDesign} objects with \code{\link[=c]{c()}} requires
both individual \code{WeightedDesign} objects to come from the same
\code{Design} (except \code{dichotomy}, see below) and have the same
target (e.g all created with \code{\link[=ate]{ate()}} or all created with \code{\link[=ett]{ett()}}, no
mixing-and-matching). All arguments to \code{\link[=c]{c()}} must be
\code{WeightedDesign}.

One exception is when concatenting \code{WeightedDesign} objects whose
\code{Design} differ only in their dichotomies. There may be cases where
the treatment is continuous or has multiple levels, and there is a need to
combine the weights from the same general design, but with different
dichotomies. Therefore multiple \code{WeightedDesign} objects can be
combined if they are identical except for their \code{@dichotomy} slots.
The resulting object will be a \code{CombinedWeightedDesign} which tracks
all individual \code{dichotomy}.
