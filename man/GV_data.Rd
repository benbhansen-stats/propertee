\description{
This dataset contains a 10\% random sample of individuals from each cable system cluster.
It specifically includes matched pairs 1â€“3, which correspond to 7 out of the 85 cable systems.
The original dataset is derived from a cluster-randomized experiment of Rock the Vote TV advertisements.
