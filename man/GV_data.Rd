\description{
This dataset is a toy example derived from a cluster-randomized
field experiment that evaluates the effect of \dQuote{Rock the Vote} TV advertisements
on voter turnout rate. The original study included 23,869 first-time voters
across 85 cable television markets in 12 states. These markets were grouped
into matched sets based on their past voter turnout rates and then randomly
assigned to either a treatment or control condition. This toy dataset is
constructed by randomly sampling 10\% of individuals from selected cable
television markets in the original dataset.
}
\details{
The original dataset was drawn from a randomized controlled trial in
which 85 cable system areas were first grouped into 40 matched sets based on
historical voter turnout. Within each matched set, one cable system area was
randomly assigned to the treatment condition, while the others served
as controls.

This toy dataset includes a subset of the original replication data,
specifically individuals from matched sets 1â€“3, which encompass 7 of the 85
cable system areas. Within these selected clusters, a 10\% random sample of
individuals was taken.

for Social and Policy Studies (ID: D005).
