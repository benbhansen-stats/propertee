\description{
Data from Tennesseeâ€™s Project STAR study.
This data frame describes student participants in the Project
STAR (Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio) field experiment
conducted in Tennessee, USA beginning in the mid-1980s, as well
as an external control group consisting of the contemporaneous
cohort of students attending a matched sample of Tennessee
schools that did not participate in the STAR experiment.
Variables are as described in Project \code{STAR} data
documentation (see references), with the exception of the
three \code{*_at_entry} variables. These variables were reconstructed
as follows: \code{grade_at_entry} indicates the grade of student's
first participation, while \code{school_at_entry} and
\code{cond_at_entry} reflect the school ID and classroom type corresponding
to the student's grade at entry to the study.
