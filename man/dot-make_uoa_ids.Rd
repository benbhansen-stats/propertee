\title{Make ID's to pass to the \code{cluster} argument of \code{vcov_tee()}}
\usage{
.make_uoa_ids(x, vcov_type, cluster = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a fitted \code{teeMod} object}

\item{vcov_type}{a string indicating model-based or specification-based
covariance estimation. Currently, "MB", "CR", and "HC" are the only strings
registered as indicating model-based estimation.}

\item{cluster}{character vector or list; optional. Specifies column names
that appear in both the covariance adjustment and direct adjustment model
dataframes. Defaults to NULL, in which case unit of assignment columns
indicated in the StudySpecification will be used for clustering. If there
are multiple clustering columns, they are concatenated together for each
row and separated by "_".}

\item{...}{arguments passed to methods}
}
\value{
A vector with length equal to the number of unique units of
observation used to fit the two models. See Details of
\code{estfun.teeMod()} for the method for determining uniqueness.
}
\description{
\code{.make_uoa_ids()} returns a factor vector of cluster ID's
that align with the order of the units of observations' contributions in
\code{estfun.teeMod()}. This is to ensure that when \code{vcov_tee()} calls
\code{sandwich::meatCL()}, the \code{cluster} argument aggregates the
correct contributions to estimating equations within clusters.
